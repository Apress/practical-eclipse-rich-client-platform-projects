Commands for modifying the model.
</p>
<p>The editor does not modify the model directly, but uses Command instances instead.
Commands can be executed, redone and undone. The framework places the sequence
of executed Commands on a CommandStack, which enables the undoing or redoing of
command sequences.
</p>
<p>Side note: Be careful when creating new instances of model elements in the redo 
or undo methods of a Command. Depending on how your commands are implemented, this can 
cause trouble when redoing or undoing a sequence of multiple commands.
<p>
More background information on the Command Design Pattern can be 
found in "Design Patterns", ISBN  0-201-63361-2.
